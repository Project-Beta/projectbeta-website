### Note from the Dev
>This was the first project I made using React. The development started with prototyping an otherwise ordinary website until Aadi suggested we go with a desktop theme. Although four days went into understanding React, I learned much more about it during development. With every step, I overcame a new challenge, the hardest one being the implementation of movement, opening and closing of windows. Having data and components kept in manageable containers saved me a lot of time and effort. After more than 2 weeks of development, debugging, searching the net for tutorials, and assistance and feedback from the Board and other core members, we finally managed to get the site up and running.

Over and out.
